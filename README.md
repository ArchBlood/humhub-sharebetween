## About ShareBetween Module

This HumHub module will add the functionality of sharing a post with users and spaces.  
I've built this Module using the source code provided by [humhub-contrib/sharebetween](https://github.com/humhub-contrib/sharebetween)

**The reason why I created a new repository with this build and didn't do a collaboration, is that the Share action here acts differently from the script provided by _humhub-contrib/sharebetween_**

## Known Issues
